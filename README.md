## Project overview

This repository consists of 3 dash apps:

1. Dashboard_1:
   - 2 line charts showing cumulative number of bot covid cases and deaths. The app enables the user to choose the country through a dropdown list
  
2. Dashboard_2:
   - Map of the world showing selected in a dropdown metric (e.g., Total cases). The data is also filtered in the other dropdown by a continent.
  
3. Dashboard_3:
   - 2 bar charts showing top n countries by total vaccinations and total vaccinations per capita, where n is a parameter adjustable through a slider.
  
All 3 apps are structured according to below schema:

- app.py
- layout.py
- callbacks.py
- index.py

To run any of the apps navigate to the app folder in the terminal (where all .py files are located)  and type `python index.py`
